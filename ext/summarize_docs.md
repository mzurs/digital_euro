# Document: [THE DIGITAL EURO – A GUIDE FOR BANKS](eba_2023_dcspwg_the-digital-euro-a-guide-for-banks_v10-6.pdf)

This document, titled **"The Digital Euro – A Guide for Banks"** by the Euro Banking Association (EBA), is a comprehensive report that analyzes the potential impact of a digital euro on the banking industry and provides strategic recommendations for banks to prepare.

### 1. Purpose and Origin of the Document

This guide is the result of discussions held in 2022 and 2023 by the EBA's **Digital Currencies & Smart Payments Working Group**, which includes experts from banks and the fintech community. Its goal is to help banks understand the upcoming digital euro, the emerging ecosystem around it, and the strategic choices they need to make.

**Important Disclaimer:** The paper is based on information available as of **March 2023**. Key details, especially regarding how banks will be paid (remuneration/compensation model) for their services, were not yet available and are not covered.

### 2. Introduction: The "Why" Behind the Digital Euro

The European Central Bank (ECB) is developing the digital euro to prepare for a more digital future where cash use may decline. It is envisioned as a **new monetary anchor** for the Eurozone. The digital euro will ensure that people can always convert their commercial bank money (the money in your regular bank account) into a digital form of central bank money, just as they can into cash today.

Banks are urged to define their strategy now, as the decision to start the realization (development) phase was expected by the end of 2023.

---

### 3. What is the Digital Euro? (Section 1)

- **Definition:** A **digital form of central bank money (CBDC)** for everyone in the Eurozone. It is not a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin; it is a direct claim on the ECB, just like a euro banknote, but in electronic form.
- **Key Design Choices (as of March 2023):**
  - **Holding Limits:** To prevent bank runs (where people quickly move money from commercial banks to the safety of the central bank), the ECB plans to limit the total amount of digital euros in circulation (around 1.5 trillion) and the amount each person can hold.
  - **Not for Investment:** It is designed for payments, not for saving or investment.
  - **Scope:** Initially for **retail transactions only** (Person-to-Person, Person-to-Business, and Person-to-Government). Business-to-Business (B2B) payments are excluded at launch.
  - **Objectives:** The ECB's goals are to:
    1.  Keep pace with the digital economy.
    2.  Preserve the central bank's role in retail payments.
    3.  Protect European "strategic autonomy" in payments.
    4.  Make payments more efficient and foster private-sector innovation.
  - **Roles:** The **Eurosystem (ECB)** will manage settlement and issuance, while **supervised intermediaries (like banks)** will handle all customer-facing activities (onboarding, wallets, transactions). There will be no direct relationship between the ECB and end-users.
  - **Usability:** It will work both **online and offline**.
  - **Technology:** The final technological platform (whether based on traditional systems or Distributed Ledger Technology - DLT) had not been decided.

---

### 4. The Emerging Digital Euro Ecosystem (Section 2)

An entire ecosystem is expected to form around the digital euro.

- **Prioritized Use Cases at Launch:**
  1.  **Person-to-Person (P2P) Payments:** The digital equivalent of handing someone cash.
  2.  **E-commerce Payments:** A low-cost, instant payment option for online shopping.
  3.  **Payments in Physical Stores:** A cashless payment method for brick-and-mortar retailers.
  4.  **Government Payments:** For things like tax payments or receiving subsidies.
- **Key Tasks in the Ecosystem:** The document outlines critical tasks like user management (onboarding, KYC/AML), liquidity management, providing interfaces, data management, and enabling offline functionality.
- **Split of Responsibilities:**
  - **Eurosystem (ECB):** Responsible for the "back-end": settlement, issuing/destroying digital euros, managing the central ledger, and onboarding intermediaries.
  - **Intermediaries (Banks, etc.):** Responsible for the "front-end": onboarding end-users, providing and managing digital euro wallets, handling transactions, and enforcing holding limits.
- **Who are the Intermediaries?** The ecosystem will not be limited to traditional banks. Other potential players include:
  - **Banks and Credit Institutions:** The natural candidates, looking to expand their service portfolio.
  - **Fintechs:** Primed to provide digital customer experiences.
  - **Payment & E-Money Institutions:** Can extend their payment and wallet services.
  - **Technology Providers:** May provide the underlying IT infrastructure.

---

### 5. Strategic Options for Banks (Section 3)

This is the core guidance for banks. The document presents three strategic options, visualized in a helpful table (Figure 8).

- **Option 1: "Ensure Compliance"**

  - **Scenario:** Do the bare minimum to meet regulatory requirements. A "wait-and-see" approach.
  - **Motivation:** Mandated by regulators; avoid large upfront investment.
  - **Risks:** Losing the customer relationship to more proactive competitors; cannibalization of other payment products without generating new revenue.

- **Option 2: "Absorb and Adapt"**

  - **Scenario:** Integrate the digital euro into existing services, seeing it as a "hygiene factor" that customers expect.
  - **Motivation:** Driven by customer demand and the fear of losing customers (since each user can likely only have one primary digital euro account).
  - **Risks:** Investments might simply replace existing revenue rather than creating new profits; risk of under-investing and not meeting customer expectations.

- **Option 3: "Expand Business"**
  - **Scenario:** Treat the digital euro as a new business pillar and actively seek new revenue streams and market opportunities.
  - **Motivation:** Unlock new business models, attract new customers, and potentially leverage future features like programmability (smart payments).
  - **Risks:** High investment that may not pay off if the digital euro is not widely adopted; high competition from other agile players.

---

### 6. How the Banking Industry Should Move Forward (Section 4)

The document recommends that banks be proactive. It outlines a spectrum of engagement options (Figure 9), from the passive to the highly active:

1.  **Wait and Adjust:** Passive; react to decisions after they are made.
2.  **Comment:** Provide feedback on ECB publications to influence decisions.
3.  **Engage:** Actively participate in ECB forums and the development of the rulebook.
4.  **Raise Awareness:** Educate customers and internal management.
5.  **Plan:** Start internal planning and impact analysis early.
6.  **Experiment:** Build prototypes to gain early market feedback and a competitive advantage.

---

### 7. Conclusions and Key Takeaways (Section 5)

The digital euro is an ambitious project with significant implications for banks. While many uncertainties remain, banks are strongly advised to:

1.  **Be Proactive:** Investigate the potential impact on their business now.
2.  **Collaborate:** Work with other players in the ecosystem to influence design and benefit from network effects.
3.  **Define a Strategy:** Have a clear plan for how to approach the digital euro at launch, and define it now.

The report also suggests that future features, like **programmability** and **B2B payments**, should be considered as they offer significant new opportunities for the industry.

In summary, this guide serves as a wake-up call and a strategic playbook for banks, urging them to move from a passive stance to active preparation for the fundamental change that the digital euro will bring to the European financial landscape.

# Document : [Digital Euro scheme’s Rulebook Development Group ](ecb.derdgp251030_RDG_progress_report_October_25.en.pdf)

This document is an official progress report from the European Central Bank (ECB), dated **30 October 2025**, providing a detailed update on the development of the **digital euro scheme rulebook**.

### 1. Purpose and Context

The digital euro is in a **two-year preparation phase**. A key goal of this phase is to create a comprehensive rulebook that will define a single set of rules, standards, and procedures for using the digital euro across the entire euro area.

The rulebook is being developed by the ECB in close collaboration with the **Rulebook Development Group (RDG)**, which includes senior representatives from European associations representing consumers, merchants, banks, payment service providers (PSPs), and other stakeholders, alongside EU institutions and national central banks.

The main goal of the rulebook is to ensure that basic digital euro services are **consistent, secure, and uniform** for users, no matter which PSP they use or which euro country they are in—similar to how cash works today.

---

### 2. Executive Summary: Key Milestone and Consultation

The report announces a major milestone: a **new draft version of the rulebook (v0.9)** was delivered to the RDG in **June 2025**, kicking off a **four-month consultation period** that runs until **31 October 2025**.

This new draft incorporates extensive feedback from the market. The previous version (released in January 2024) received **around 2,000 unique comments** from the RDG and its constituents. The ECB processed these as follows:

- **36%** were directly incorporated into the new draft.
- **48%** were carefully considered by the Eurosystem and RDG workstreams. Some were incorporated, some didn't require changes, and others were excluded with explanations.
- **10%** were deemed out of the RDG's scope (e.g., topics like holding limits) and were forwarded to other relevant forums.
- **6%** are under consideration for future versions of the rulebook.

The new draft is significantly expanded and restructured, adding key new areas like **minimum user experience (UX) requirements, brand rules, and detailed technical implementation specifications**.

---

### 3. The Rulebook's Structure and Key Components

The rulebook is designed to standardize the core experience while allowing PSPs flexibility to innovate. It distinguishes between **mandatory provisions** and **supporting/optional guidance**.

The rulebook's functional scope is built around three core digital euro services:

1.  **Access Management:** Onboarding/offboarding users, managing accounts.
2.  **Liquidity Management:** Funding/defunding digital euros, and the "waterfall" / "reverse waterfall" processes (automatic conversion to/from commercial bank money when holding limits are breached).
3.  **Transaction Management:** Initiating, authorizing, and completing payments.

Here’s a breakdown of the key components and their relationships:

- **Illustrative User Journeys & Wireframes:** These are **supporting documents** (not mandatory) that show ideal user pathways for different use cases (e.g., paying in a store, e-commerce). They have increased by 60% to 109 journeys and include visual blueprints (wireframes).
- **Minimum UX Requirements:** These are **mandatory rules** to ensure a consistent, recognizable, and user-friendly experience across all PSPs. They include both generic rules (applicable to all services, e.g., authentication must be as easy as for other payments) and specific rules for particular journeys (e.g., for e-commerce or POS payments).
- **End-to-End (E2E) Flows:** These are detailed visual and descriptive flows (around 130 in total) that outline every step, actor, and decision point for each digital euro service, from initiation to completion.
- **Business Rules:** These are **mandatory** instructions that apply the business logic for PSPs when conducting digital euro processes.
- **Implementation Specifications:** These are **mandatory technical requirements** for PSPs, divided into:
  - **Front-end specifications:** Cover interactions in the user and PSP domains (e.g., between a user's phone and a merchant's terminal).
  - **Back-end specifications:** Describe how PSPs interact with the core **Digital Euro Service Platform (DESP)** run by the Eurosystem, covering settlement, access management, and alias lookup.

---

### 4. New and Updated Areas in the Draft Rulebook

The report highlights several critical new sections:

- **Dispute Management:** A full framework has been added, outlining valid reasons for disputes (e.g., incorrect transaction amount), the process for raising them, required evidence, and status tracking to ensure user protection and consistency.
- **Brand Rules:** To build trust and recognition, the rulebook now includes rules on how the digital euro logo and branding must be used across all channels (apps, websites, POS terminals), ensuring a unified image.
- **PSP Onboarding Process:** A clear, three-phase process for PSPs to join the scheme has been defined: 1) Application and validation, 2) Certification and approval of their solutions, and 3) Completion and go-live.

---

### 5. Focus on Open Standards and Interoperability

A key priority is to use **existing open, non-proprietary industry standards** to minimize costs and enhance interoperability. The ECB is evaluating several standards for potential reuse:

- **CPACE:** For contactless card and NFC payments (e.g., in-store).
- **European Payments Council (EPC) Standards:** For QR-code payments and potentially others.
- **nexo Standards:** For retail payments messaging, including at ATMs.
- **Berlin Group Standards:** For alias-based payments and "pay-by-link" functionality.

The final adoption of standards will be reflected in the rulebook's implementation specifications and will require PSPs to obtain relevant certifications.

---

### 6. Next Steps and Conclusion

The immediate next step is the conclusion of the consultation on **31 October 2025**. The ECB will then process all feedback to further refine the rulebook.

Future work includes:

- Finalizing areas dependent on vendor specifications and standard selection.
- Developing specifications for offline payments and NFC transactions.
- Setting up the full certification framework for PSPs.
- Ensuring the final rulebook is flexible enough to incorporate any changes from the ongoing legislative process for the **Digital Euro Regulation**.

In summary, this document illustrates that the digital euro project has moved from the investigation and design phase into a highly technical and collaborative **preparation phase**. The development of a detailed, market-informed rulebook is a critical step toward building a unified, secure, and innovative digital payment system for Europe.

# Document : [DESP Experimentation Portal - User Guide](ecb.deprep250926_innovationplatform_annex.en.pdf)

This document is a **technical user guide** for a specific experimental platform, not an official policy document. It's part of a controlled test environment set up by the European Central Bank (ECB).

### 1. Purpose and Context: The "Pioneer Workstream"

This guide is for participants in the **"Pioneer Workstream,"** an initiative under the ECB's broader **Innovation Partnerships** project.

- **Goal:** To collaborate with external experts ("Pioneers") to develop and test advanced use cases for a digital euro, specifically focusing on **"Conditional Payments."**
- **Important Disclaimer:** This is purely an **experimentation platform**. The design, technical setup, and features described **do not represent any aspect of a potential real-world digital euro implementation.** It's a sandbox for learning.

### 2. Core Concept: Conditional Payments

The entire experiment revolves around **Conditional Payments**. These are not simple, instant transfers. Instead, they are transactions that are automatically executed only when pre-defined conditions are met.

- **Key Mechanism:** The core functionality being tested is the **reservation of funds**. Think of it like putting a "hold" on a specific amount in your account for a specific purpose.
- **Benefit:** This automates complex payment scenarios, reduces manual work, and minimizes errors.
- **Example Use Cases:** While not specified here, this could be used for things like:
  - **Escrow Services:** Funds are released only when a buyer confirms receipt of goods.
  - **Streaming Payments:** Micropayments are automatically made for each minute of a service used (like a toll road).
  - **Smart Contracts:** Payments triggered by real-world data (e.g., an insurance payout triggered by a verified weather event).

### 3. The Technical Platform: DESP Experimentation Portal

Pioneers use this portal to interact with the **Digital Euro Service Platform (DESP)** via its Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). The platform simulates a environment where a single participant can act as both the payer's and payee's Payment Service Provider (PSP) to test transaction flows without needing to coordinate with another real company.

#### Key Technical Components:

- **APIs:** The platform offers several versions of APIs (REST and gRPC) for programmers to interact with. Newer versions (V2, V3) add more features.
- **Authentication:** A simple username and password (BasicAuth) is used to access the platform.
- **Core Functions (Workflows):** The guide outlines the main actions a pioneer can perform:
  1.  **Create Holdings:** Establish a digital euro balance.
  2.  **Create Reservations:** Place a hold on a portion of the funds for a future conditional payment.
  3.  **Manage Reservations:** Update the amount, expiration date, or cancel the reservation.
  4.  **Execute Payments:** Create a payment that uses a reserved amount.

#### The "Waterfall" Mechanisms in Practice

The document introduces a critical feature for the experiment: the **Dedicated Cash Account (DCA)**.

- **What it is:** A simulated commercial bank account for each pioneer PSP with a balance of €10,000.
- **Its Purpose:** To enable the **"reverse waterfall" and "waterfall"** mechanisms _within the conditional payment flows_.
  - **Reverse Waterfall (Funding):** If a pioneer wants to create a reservation that exceeds their available digital euro balance, the system can **automatically convert funds from their DCA (commercial bank money) into digital euros** to cover it.
  - **Waterfall (Defunding):** If a payment would cause the recipient's digital euro balance to exceed a holding limit (simulated as 0 in this test), the excess is **automatically converted back to commercial bank money** in their DCA.

### 4. The Reservation Lifecycle

A key part of the guide is explaining the life of a "reservation" of funds, which has different states:

- **ENAB (Enabled):** The reservation is active and funds are on hold.
- **EXEC (Executed):** The reservation has been successfully used for a payment and is closed.
- **EXPI (Expired):** The reservation's time limit passed without being used, and it is closed.
- **RJCT (Rejected):** The reservation was rejected (e.g., due to insufficient funds).

The guide provides a state transition diagram and rules for how payments (full, partial, or overpayments) move the reservation between these states.

### 5. Evolution of the Platform

The "Release Notes" section shows how the platform has been developed over time, adding new capabilities with each version:

- **Early 2025:** Basic functions for creating holdings and reservations.
- **Mid-2025:** Introduction of the DCA and the waterfall/reverse waterfall mechanisms for conditional payments.
- **Mid-2025:** Addition of more API types (gRPC) and features like digital signatures (in V3).

### 6. Practical Information for Pioneers

The FAQ section addresses practical concerns for the testers:

- **Communication:** Primarily via a dedicated email mailbox.
- **Feedback:** The ECB distributes feedback forms every three weeks to improve the platform based on pioneer input.
- **Scope:** The current focus is on single-PSP testing, but the ECB is considering adding **cross-PSP transactions** in the future based on feedback.
- **Future Plans:** New API endpoints and features will be rolled out continuously, with a roadmap provided to pioneers.

---

### Summary

In essence, this document is a **technical manual for a live experiment.** The ECB has built a simplified but functional simulation of a digital euro system to test one of its most innovative potential features: **programmable, conditional payments.**

By giving "Pioneers" access to this sandbox, the ECB can gather real-world data on technical feasibility, use cases, and potential challenges, which will inform the final design of the digital euro _if and when_ it is officially launched.

# Document : [A view on recent assessments of digital euro investment costs for the euro area banking sector ](Costs_Report.pdf)

This document is a detailed analysis by the European Central Bank (ECB) in response to studies from the banking industry that claimed implementing a digital euro would be extremely expensive.

### Core Purpose and Main Argument

The ECB's primary goal is to counter high cost estimates from the banking sector (notably a **PwC study that predicted €18 billion** for the euro area) by arguing that these studies ignore the massive cost-saving potential of **synergies and cost mutualisation**.

The ECB's central thesis is: **If banks work together and use shared solutions (as they already do for other payment services), the total investment cost would be much lower, falling within a range of €4 billion to €5.77 billion**, which is close to the European Commission's earlier estimate of €2.8 billion to €5.4 billion.

---

### Detailed Breakdown by Section

#### 1. Executive Summary (Page 3-4)

- **Context:** The banking industry has conducted studies on digital euro costs. The ECB acknowledges them but presents its own view.
- **Key Finding:** Significant cost savings are possible through **synergies** (using shared solutions) and **cost mutualisation** (spreading costs across multiple banks).
- **Adjusted Cost Estimate:** When synergies are properly accounted for, the banking industry's own figures should lead to a total cost of **€4 billion to €5.77 billion** (or **€1 billion to €1.44 billion annually** over four years).
- **Comparison:** This is comparable to past initiatives like the Payment Services Directive (PSD2) and cheaper than the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA).
- **Scope:** This analysis focuses on "external" synergies (outsourcing to vendors), not "internal" ones (reusing existing bank processes). It also does not discuss potential revenue or business model benefits for banks.

#### 2. Introduction (Page 5)

- **Objective:** This note assesses the potential for synergies, synthesizes evidence from past projects, and presents a new cost extrapolation.
- **Key Insight:** The potential for synergies is huge. Within banking groups, synergies can be over 90%. Even between independent banks in a market, synergies are significant (e.g., 30% in Germany, 35% in Italy).

#### 3. Available Evidence on Potential Costs (Page 6-7)

- **The PwC Study:** Commissioned by banking associations, it estimated **€18 billion** by extrapolating from a sample of 19 banks. It categorized banks by size and applied undisclosed synergy factors.
- **ECB's Critique:** The ECB finds this figure too high and has also engaged with authors of other, undisclosed studies to get a more complete picture.

#### 4. Accounting for Synergies and Cost Mutualisation (Page 8-15)

This is the core of the ECB's argument.

- **Current Practice:** Banks already heavily rely on shared solutions and outsourcing for payments (e.g., card processing, A2A solutions like Bizum).
- **Two Types of Synergies:**

  1.  **Banking Group Synergies:** For banks within a unified group (like German savings banks), a "build once, deploy to many" model is used. The analysis uses Institutional Protection Schemes (IPS) as a proxy for these groups.
      - **Potential:** Synergies here are extremely high, ranging from **90% to 98%** in the base case. This means the cost for the entire group is less than 10% of what it would cost if each bank acted alone.
  2.  **Market Synergies:** For independent banks outside of these groups, savings come from using the same external vendors or shared market infrastructures.
      - **Methodology:** The ECB scored each euro area country on five factors to calculate a market synergy factor (a percentage of cost reduction):
        - Vendor Concentration
        - Presence of Multi-Country Vendors
        - End-to-End Vendor Coverage
        - Outsourcing Level
        - History of Collaboration
      - **Result:** The weighted average market synergy factor for the euro area is **30%**.

- **Scenario Framework:** The analysis considers three scenarios to account for uncertainty:
  - **Base Case:** Group synergies 90-98%, Market synergies 30%.
  - **Low Synergies Case:** Group synergies 72-78%, Market synergies 25%.
  - **High Synergies Case:** Group synergies 90-98%, Market synergies 40%.

#### 5. Adjustments to PwC's Base Estimates (Page 16-18)

The ECB argues that PwC's cost assumptions are inflated because they don't reflect the actual digital euro design and current market trends. They make four key downward adjustments:

1.  **Physical Cards (-€6M):** Banks already have card issuing capabilities; no need for major new infrastructure.
2.  **POS Terminals (-€7M):** PwC assumed a full hardware replacement. The ECB argues most terminals can be updated via software, and natural replacement cycles will mean many terminals are already modern by launch.
3.  **ATMs (-€5.1M):** Similar to POS, many ATMs already support required functions (NFC/QR), and upgrades can be gradual. Many ATMs are also outsourced.
4.  **Fee Calculation (-€2M):** This task will be performed by the Eurosystem, not banks.

**Overall, these adjustments reduce the average bank's estimated cost by 16%.**

#### 6. Data and Methodology for Extrapolation (Page 19-20)

- **Bank Universe:** The ECB uses a list of **1,929** euro area credit institutions that have a retail business (and would therefore be obliged to offer the digital euro). This differs from PwC's list.
- **Mapping:** These banks are mapped to PwC's size clusters (Top, Large, Medium, Small) based on their total assets.
- **IPS Identification:** Banks that are part of an IPS are identified to apply the high banking group synergies.

#### 7. Extrapolation Results and Sensitivity Analysis (Page 21-23)

This is where all the pieces come together. The adjusted costs are applied to the 1,929 banks, and the synergy factors are applied.

- **Base Scenario (Adjusted PwC + Base Synergies):** Total cost = **€5.77 billion**.
- **Other Banking Studies (with synergies):** Total cost = **€4.0 - €4.2 billion**.
- **High Synergies Scenario:** Costs fall to **€5.07 billion**.
- **Low Synergies Scenario:** Costs rise to **€8.49 billion**, showing the critical importance of collaboration.

The report also puts these costs in perspective:

- They represent about **0.7% of the euro area banking sector's 2023 net income**.
- For large banks, it's about **3.4% of their average annual IT "change-the-bank" spending**.

#### 8. Conclusion (Page 24)

The ECB reiterates that leveraging synergies makes the digital euro affordable and that its analysis confirms the plausibility of the European Commission's cost range. It emphasizes its openness to work with the industry to minimize costs and reuse existing standards.

---

### Annex 1: Deep Dive on Market Synergies (Page 25-52)

This section provides the detailed, country-by-country analysis that underpins the market synergy factors.

- **Vendor Assessment (A1.1):** The ECB identified 19 key vendors across Europe (e.g., Worldline, Nexi, SIBS, Temenos) and categorized them (Pan-European Champions, National Champions, etc.).
- **Country Scoring (A1.1.1 - A1.3):** Each euro area country was scored (on a scale of 0 to 1) for:
  - **Vendor Concentration:** How dominated the market is by a few providers.
  - **Multi-Country Vendors:** The presence of vendors that operate across borders.
  - **End-to-End Coverage:** Whether a vendor can provide a full suite of services.
  - **Outsourcing Level:** How much banks in that country already outsource their payment processes.
  - **History of Collaboration:** Evidence of past successful joint projects (e.g., shared ATM networks, A2A schemes).
- **Final Synergy Factors (A2.1 & A2.2):** The scores for the five dimensions were summed for each country and converted into a final "cost synergy potential" percentage. The tables on pages 43 and 44 show these results for all countries under the base, low, and high scenarios.

### Summary in Simple Terms

Think of the ECB telling the banks:

"You say building the digital euro will cost €18 billion. We think you're wrong because:

1.  **You're not working together:** If you all use the same few companies to build the systems (like you already do for cards and mobile payments), the cost per bank plummets. Our research shows this could cut costs by 30% on average.
2.  **Your math is off:** You've included costs for things that either won't be needed (like all new card terminals) or will be paid for by us, the central bank.
3.  **If you cooperate,** the real total cost for the entire euro area banking sector is more likely to be between **€4 billion and €6 billion**, which is a manageable and reasonable investment."

# Document : [Rilevazione_economica_2024](Rilevazione_economica_2024.pdf)

The document, **"Rilevazione sull'IT nel settore bancario italiano - Profili economici e organizzativi - Esercizio 2024"** (Survey on IT in the Italian Banking Sector - Economic and Organizational Profiles - 2024 Exercise)[cite: 411, 419], is a key annual report on technology spending and organization in the Italian banking sector. It is curated by CIPA (Interbank Convention for Automation) and ABI (Italian Banking Association)[cite: 417, 451].

---

## 1. Explanation of the Report's Scope

The report provides a detailed view of the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) landscape for Italian banks:

- **Focus:** It analyzes the **economic** (costs, investments, spending trends) and **organizational** (IT staff, sourcing models, innovation initiatives) aspects of IT within the sector[cite: 453].
- **Coverage:** The data for the 2024 exercise was drawn from **23 banking groups**, representing approximately **92% of the sector's total assets**, and **32 individual banks**[cite: 377, 378].
- **Key Figures:** The 23 participating banking groups reported a consolidated IT **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)** of approximately **€6.3 billion**[cite: 377].
- **Structure:** The report is split into three main chapters:
  - **Chapter 1 (Economic Profiles):** Deep dive into the TCO, Cash-out IT, compliance costs, 'Run vs. Change' spending (maintenance vs. development), Public Cloud adoption, and IT investments.
  - **Chapter 2 (Organizational Profiles):** Examines IT sourcing (in-house vs. outsourcing), Cloud computing, Cybersecurity elements, FinTech collaboration, and IT personnel profiles.
  - **Chapter 3 (Banks):** Focuses on the economic and organizational profiles of individual banks (as opposed to large banking groups).

| **2.5 Euro digitale** [cite: 394, 395]                | This section specifically collects and presents the **forecasts** from Italian banking groups regarding the **IT investments** and the **increase in Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)** they expect to sustain to prepare their operational processes for the Digital Euro[cite: 394, 395]. | This provides market-driven, bottom-up cost estimates from real-world institutions, which is critical for comparing against high-level estimates like the ones from the PwC or ECB.                                                                                |
| **1.1.3 Costi di integrazione** [cite: 385, 390]      | Analyzes the trend of **integration costs**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | This directly relates to the expense of linking new digital systems (like the Digital Euro) into existing **Legacy Monolithic Systems**, a major driver of overall cost.                                                                                           |
| **1.3.3 Run e change**                                | Divides IT spending into **'Run'** (maintaining existing systems) and **'Change'** (new development and projects).                                                                                                                                                                       | The ratio between Run and Change indicates the pace of modernization. A higher 'Run' portion suggests more money is tied up in simply keeping the old 'legacy' systems operating, leaving less for 'agile' innovation.                                             |
| **2.1 Sourcing IT & 2.2 Cloud computing**             | Discusses how banks utilize outsourcing and their transition to the Public Cloud.                                                                                                                                                                                                        | This relates to the concept of **synergy** and **cost mutualization**. Banks relying on shared (outsourced) IT and Cloud infrastructure are generally better positioned for cost-saving synergies when implementing a standardized solution like the Digital Euro. |
| **1.2.2 Sicurezza IT & 2.3 Elementi di Sicurezza IT** | Details IT security costs and staff allocation. Highlights the **high priority given to cybersecurity**, noting that groups with fewer internal IT employees (and thus more outsourcing) allocate a larger percentage of technical staff to cyber defense[cite: 381].                    | This is a key operational challenge, as the Digital Euro introduces new security and compliance requirements.                                                                                                                                                      |

=======================================
How Offline Payments Work
Pre-funding: A user must first pre-fund their digital euro wallet (on a smartphone or secure smart card) from their regular bank account while online. This step is similar to withdrawing physical cash from an ATM.
Direct Device-to-Device Transfer: The actual payment happens offline, directly between the payer's device and the payee's device (e.g., via Near-Field Communication or another secure proximity technology), without needing an internet connection or a third-party intermediary at the time of the transaction.
Local Validation: The transaction is validated locally between the two devices using secure elements and cryptography to prevent issues like double-spending.
Post-synchronization: When the user (or the merchant) next connects to the internet, their wallet synchronizes with their payment service provider (PSP) to update balances and settle the transactions
