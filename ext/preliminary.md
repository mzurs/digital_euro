# **Implementation Models for Banks in the Context of the Digital Euro**

**Research Focus:**  
This thesis explores how banks can strategically implement the Digital Euro in a cost-efficient, scalable, and compliant manner within the ECB’s Digital Euro Service Platform (DESP) framework. It investigates different strategic implementation approaches (ranging from proprietary to collaborative and hybrid setups) and assesses their financial, technical, and organizational implications, including cost synergies and outsourcing. The goal is to derive recommendations for banks on how to structure their implementation to ensure efficiency, interoperability, and long-term adaptability.

**Outline:**

1. **Introduction**  
   - **Background & Motivation:** Overview of the Digital Euro initiative and the intermediated model. Emphasis on the Digital Euro Service Platform (DESP), rulebook requirements, and implications for bank back-end integration (e.g., conditional payments, open standards).  
   - **Problem Statement:** Banks face strategic and technical uncertainty regarding implementation choices, cost distribution (e.g., €18bn estimates), synergies (e.g., 30-40% via outsourcing), and the extent of collaboration versus proprietary development.  
   - **Research Objectives & Questions:**  
     1. What strategic implementation approaches can banks adopt to integrate the Digital Euro effectively under the DESP framework?  
     2. How can collaboration, infrastructure sharing, or vendor partnerships contribute to greater cost-efficiency and scalability?  
     3. Which organizational, technological, and regulatory factors (e.g., outsourcing levels, rulebook specs) most strongly influence implementation success?  
     4. How can banks position themselves strategically to balance efficiency, control, and innovation capacity during Digital Euro adoption?  
   - **Structure of the Thesis:** Short overview of each chapter.

2. **Theoretical Framework and Literature Review**  
   2.1 **Institutional and Regulatory Context:** Overview of ECB governance, DESP architecture (e.g., API/gRPC for conditional payments), and Rulebook requirements for intermediaries (e.g., front-end/back-end specs, onboarding).  
   2.2 **Payment Infrastructure and Collaboration Models:** Review of shared service structures (e.g., SEPA, EBA Clearing, TARGET Instant Payment, Bizum) and outsourcing patterns.  
   2.3 **Cost and Efficiency in Digital Payment Implementations:** Discussion of ECB (2025) and PwC (2025) cost studies; lessons from PSD2 and instant-payment rollouts, including synergies (e.g., vendor concentration, market-specific outsourcing).  
   2.4 **Research Gap:** Existing studies estimate macro-level costs but rarely examine bank-level implementation strategies or concrete organizational setups (e.g., hybrid models leveraging DESP experimentation).

3. **Methodology**  
   3.1 **Research Design:** Qualitative, exploratory design combining expert interviews, qualitative content analysis, and case studies for triangulation.  
   3.2 **Method 1 – Expert Interviews:**  
      - Objective: Identify and compare practical implementation approaches and collaboration strategies among banks and service providers.  
      - Target Groups: Banks (e.g., Commerzbank, BNP Paribas, DZ Bank); Infrastructure Providers (e.g., EBA Clearing, Worldline, Nexi); Consultancies/Institutions (e.g., Roland Berger, PwC, ECB Digital Euro Task Force).  
      - Interview Format: Semi-structured (10–12 interviews, 30–60 min).  
      - Analysis: Thematic coding (MAXQDA/Atlas.ti) following Mayring’s qualitative content analysis.  
      - Outcome: Typology of implementation models (shared, outsourced, hybrid, in-house).  
   3.3 **Method 2 – Qualitative Content Analysis (Document Analysis):**  
      - Objective: Derive cost drivers, governance frameworks, and technical dependencies from secondary sources.  
      - Data Sources: ECB and EC cost assessment reports, DESP/rulebook documentation; industry whitepapers (e.g., PwC, EBA guide).  
      - Procedure: Code texts for recurring themes (cost pooling, infrastructure sharing, API architecture, governance).  
      - Outcome: Comparative matrix of proposed implementation pathways and their financial/organizational impact.  
   3.4 **Method 3 – Case Study Comparison:**  
      - Objective: Test models in context using real/simulated examples (e.g., high vs. low outsourcing markets).  
      - Data Sources: Document-derived cases (e.g., PwC bank samples, DESP use cases).  
      - Procedure: Analyze trade-offs (e.g., costs vs. scalability) across archetypes.  
      - Outcome: Validated recommendations with sensitivity to uncertainties.  
   3.5 **Methodological Rationale:** The combination strengthens validity, offering micro- (interviews/cases) and macro-level (analysis) understanding.

4. **Empirical Findings**  
   - 4.1 **Interview Results:** Identify preferred implementation routes, collaboration formats, and expected challenges (cost, governance, compliance).  
   - 4.2 **Document and Case Study Results:** Summarize quantified cost expectations (€4–6 billion overall, 30–40% savings through shared infrastructure), policy positions, and market variations (e.g., outsourcing scores).  
   - 4.3 **Integrated Synthesis:** Derive four archetypes of implementation models:  
     1. In-house Integration Model (high control, proprietary systems).  
     2. Shared Infrastructure Model (collaboration via schemes/utilities).  
     3. Vendor/Outsourcing Model (reliance on providers like Nexi for scalability).  
     4. Hybrid Collaborative Model (mix of inhouse and shared, leveraging synergies).

5. **Discussion**  
   - Interpret findings relative to efficiency, scalability, and strategic flexibility (e.g., synergies via outsourcing).  
   - Discuss trade-offs: Control vs. cost savings; speed vs. interoperability; market-specific factors (e.g., high outsourcing enables shared models).  
   - Evaluate long-term strategic roles for banks under each model (e.g., innovation via rulebook flexibility).  
   - Connect results to theories of platform governance and network economics.

6. **Conclusion, Recommendations, and Outlook**  
   - Summarize key insights and contributions (e.g., hybrid models recommended for most banks due to 30-40% synergies).  
   - Provide recommendations for banks preparing DESP integration (e.g., assess outsourcing levels, prioritize collaborative vendors).  
   - Outline next research steps post-DESP publication (e.g., pilot evaluation, cross-bank cooperation models).  
   - Discuss policy implications for the ECB and national regulators (e.g., promote open standards for cost minimization).

**Expected Contribution**  
- Provides a structured analysis of feasible implementation models for the Digital Euro.  
- Quantifies and contextualizes cost, synergy, and collaboration implications for banks.  
- Offers a practical reference for institutions, consultants, and policymakers designing operational roll-out frameworks.
