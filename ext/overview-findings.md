### Overview of Findings 


#### Points
   - PwC estimates €18bn in total change costs for euro area banks, primarily in technical layers (75%, e.g., apps, interfaces, ATMs/POS hardware). 

   - Main drivers include heterogeneous IT landscapes, operational adjustments (e.g., back-office, fraud/liquidity management), and commercial go-to-market strategies. 

   - ECB's report adjusts PwC figures downward by accounting for synergies (e.g., 30-40% savings in some countries via shared vendors).
   
   - Market synergies arise from vendor concentration (e.g., Nets/Nexi, IBM), multi-country presence, end-to-end coverage, outsourcing levels (higher in smaller markets like Portugal >0.7 score), and historical collaborations (e.g., Institutional Protection Schemes). 
   
   - Outsourcing enables cost mutualisation (e.g., shared ATMs, card processing); low outsourcing (e.g., Germany 0.4) limits synergies. Exemplary opportunities include leveraging existing infrastructures to avoid duplication.
   
   - ECB extrapolates adjusted PwC figures, showing base synergy cases and scenarios (e.g., varying vendor adoption); emphasizes quantitative modeling with qualitative insights for realistic estimates.
