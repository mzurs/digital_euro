# **Implementation Models and Approaches**

   - **Proprietary/Inhouse vs. Collaborative/Shared Models**: 
      - Banks face choices between inhouse development (higher control but costs) and shared/outsourced models (e.g., via vendors like Worldline/Nexi for scalability). Hybrid models combine inhouse core systems with outsourced components (e.g., ATMs to utilities). Historical examples (e.g., SEPA, TARGET Instant Payments) show shared infrastructures reduce costs 30-40%. 
   
   - **Outsourcing and Vendor Reliance**: 
      - Higher outsourcing correlates with synergies; e.g., card issuing/acquiring often outsourced (medium score ~0.5 across Europe). Models like "white-label" solutions or co-branded apps allow smaller banks to leverage larger providers. 
   
   - **Hybrid and Modular Approaches**: 
      - Rulebook allows flexibility (e.g., optional UX provisions); banks can integrate digital euro into existing apps/websites via modular vendors (e.g., Temenos, Oracle). DESP experimentation supports hybrid testing for conditional payments.    

####  **Technical and Regulatory Specifications for Models**
   - **Rulebook and DESP Integration**: 
      - Rulebook mandates standardized front-end (e.g., UX for P2P/e-com, PSP apps) and back-end specs (e.g., PSP-DESP interfaces for settlement/access). Open standards minimize adaptation costs; onboarding includes certification/testing. PSPs retain flexibility for innovation in hybrid models. (From RDG report)
   - **DESP-Specific Implementation**: 
      - Focuses on conditional payments (fund reservations); API/gRPC for prototyping; digital signatures for security. Timeline emphasizes joint experimentation, aiding collaborative models. (From DESP guide)
   - **Preparatory Steps for Banks**: 
      - Assess internal capabilities, explore partnerships/vendors; steps include evaluating IT impacts, compliance, and customer integration. Guide stresses collaboration to mitigate uncertainties. (From EBA guide)

####  **Challenges and Recommendations**
   - Fragmented setups increase costs; synergies via collaboration enhance scalability. Banks should prioritize primary sources (e.g., ECB rulebook) for neutrality. (Cross-document: PwC, Costs_Report.pdf, RDG report)

   - Documents suggest collaborative/hybrid models offer best efficiency (e.g., 30-40% savings), especially for smaller banks, while large banks may prefer proprietary for control. No document contradicts the outline's archetypes (inhouse, shared, vendor/hybrid).
